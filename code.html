                <h3>Hangman Game project</h3>
                <p>The Hangman Game App Development project aims to create an engaging and 
                    interactive mobile application for Android users. The app is designed to provide 
                    users with a classic word-guessing game experience while leveraging the 
                    capabilities of the Android platform. The Hangman Game App offers a fun and 
                    educational way for users to enhance their vocabulary, word recognition, and 
                    problem-solving skills.
                    The Hangman Game App is built using Android Studio, a powerful integrated 
                    development environment (IDE) for Android application development. It 
                    utilizes Java and XML as the primary programming languages and follows the 
                    Material Design guidelines to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly 
                    interface.
